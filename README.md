## Data Quality/Data Cleaning Preparation Assessments:

Data quality is essential to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. The dataset was assessed and cleaned through several steps in Power Query, which helped to address data integrity issues. Here is a summary of the data quality processes applied:

* Duplicates Removal: Any duplicate rows were removed to avoid skewed sales counts or duplicated revenue data.
* Missing Values Handling: Missing or incomplete values in product names or store locations were filled based on contextual data when possible. For sales data, any missing entries were replaced with estimates where appropriate.
* Data Type Standardization: Numeric fields, such as sales and quantity, were formatted consistently, and date fields were standardized to facilitate time-series analysis.
* Outliers Identification: High and low outliers in sales volume were reviewed to ensure they represented legitimate transactions and were not the result of data entry errors.
* Consistency Checks: Product names and store locations were standardized, addressing any variations in naming conventions across records.
